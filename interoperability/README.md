# Interoperability

The real value of repositories lies in the potential to interconnect them to create a network of repositories, a network that can provide unified access to research outputs and be \(re-\) used by machines and researchers. In order to achieve this potential, we need interoperability. 

Interoperability across repositories requires standardized approaches to metadata, vocabularies, usage statistics, and other new behaviours as presented in next generation repositories section of the toolkit.

In addition to interoperability across repositories, we also want to ensure that repositories and other related systems are interoperable with each other, such as repositories with CRIS systems.
