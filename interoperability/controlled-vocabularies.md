In the following video, Rowan Brownlee presents on how publish controlled vocabularies including an introduction to SKOS, why it was developed, and how it may be used to express the features of a controlled vocabulary; tools for creating, managing, publishing and accessing vocabularies, including those provided by the Australian National Data Service \(ANDS\);  vocabulary registry interoperability. Slides can be found at [this](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.230857) link.

## COAR Controlled Vocabularies

COAR develops a set of controlled vocabularies for the bibliographic metadata elements used in records describing research outputs. In order to define the controlled vocabularies, the COAR Controlled Vocabularies Editorial Board analyzes existing vocabularies and dictionaries and will use the most appropriate existing terms whenever possible. In the case where there are gaps, new terms are defined by the group in collaboration with the repository community.

[COAR Resource Type Vocabulary](https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/deliverables/): It defines concepts to identify the genre of a resource. Such resources, like publications, research data, audio and video objects, are typically deposited in institutional and thematic repositories or published in ejournals.

[COAR Access Rights Vocabulary](https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/access-rights-vocabulary/): It defines concepts to declare the access status of a resource. Multilingual labels regard regional distinctions in language and term.
