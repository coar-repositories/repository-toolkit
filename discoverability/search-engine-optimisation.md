# Search engine optimisation

Kenning Arlitsch presents "Driving Traffic to Institutional Repositories: How Search Engine Optimization can Increase the Number of Downloads from IR". From the introduction, "this presentation discusses search engine optimization techniques, especially for Google Scholar, which can be responsible for the majority of referrals that result in IR file downloads. The presentation also introduces a new web service called RAMP \(Repository Analytics & Metrics Portal\) that accurately counts file downloads from IR and requires no installation or training." Slides can be found at [this](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.894564) link.
