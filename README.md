# Repository Toolkit

Providing support for the Open Access repository community from institutions, countries, regions and disciplines, through international cooperation and information sharing is an important objective for COAR. As such, COAR aims to maintain a list of resources and links to relevant training materials for repository managers and administrators.

In the fall of 2018, COAR launched this Repository Toolkit. The aim of the toolkit is to provide repository managers with best practices and educational resources to support interoperability, discoverability and the development of value added services. The toolkit provides access to resources related to the role of repositories, discovery and interoperability, next generation repositories, and contains links to technical information for implementing and managing repository platforms.
