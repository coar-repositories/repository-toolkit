"Research data management is part of the research process, aims to make the research process as efficient as possible and meet expectations and requirements of the university \(such as the requirements of the [TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/researchdata-framework-policy.pdf)\), research funders, and legislation. By managing your data you will: 

* guarantee research integrity and replication.
* ensure that research data are authentic, complete, and reliable.
* minimize the risk of losing your data.
* increase research efficiency.
* prevent duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data.
* meet funding agency requirement." \([Why data management?](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/research-data-management/why-data-management/) by TUDelft\)
