# Introduction

The toolkit provides access to best practice resources related to the role of repositories, discovery and interoperability, next generation repositories, and contains links to technical information for implementing and managing repository platforms.

The main topics and sub-topics can be found in the left hand column. 

Wherever possible, we have made an effort to include resources in languages other than English. 

Please contact us at office\[at\]coar-repositories.org with any valuable resources which are not yet included here.

You can also contribute to the toolkit by commenting through [hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is%20) annotation tool or on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coar-repositories/repository-toolkit) by creating an issue.
